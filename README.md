# Interactive Gaussian process sensitivity analysis of a P2D-SEI battery degradation model

This repository includes an interactive sensitivity analysis of a P2D-SEI battery degradation model based on a surrogate Gaussian process regression model presented in a Python notebook.

The dataset used for training the models is included in the dataset directory.

A tutorial demonstrating the sensitivity analysis method is available in a [separate repository](https://github.com/big-map/sa_p2d_sei_interactive).


## Run the interactive Python notebook with Google Colab

You can run the interactive Python notebook using Google Colab without the need to install anything on your computer.
This requires a Google account.

* Go to [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/).
* Select 'File' > 'Open notebook'.
* Select 'GitHub'.
* Enter the GitHub URL to this repository and hit return.
* Select the notebook you would like to open.
